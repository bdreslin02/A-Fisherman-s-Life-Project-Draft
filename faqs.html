	<h1 class="contenth1">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
		<h2 class="contenth2">Charters</h2>
			<h3 class="alignleft">How much does the chef cost?</h3>
				<p>We brought on a former 2-Michelin star restaurant chef to provide charter guests with a world-class dining experience on our yachts. The chef is only available 
				on our 8-hour and 12-hour excursions. Our menu is curated according to the season. We charge $29.99 per person to taste the exquisite creations of our chef. All meals 
				include an appetizer, entrée, dessert, and a drink. Meals can be prepared family-style for $15.95 per person. Our chef can also prepare and cook any of your catches
				to your liking for an additional $5.50 per catch. Please notify us of any food allergies at least 4 days prior to your scheduled booking. 
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Are tips required?</h3>
				<p>No, tips are not required. However, they are greatly appreciated by your captains and chef. They also indicate your satisfaction of our charter services, which we 
				use to refine our offerings.
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">What if bad weather approaches while on the yacht?</h3>
				<p>Depending on water conditions, we will either cancel your booking or reschedule your party for another day or time. If already on the water, your captain will bring 
				the vessel back to the marina or near safe land if more than 50 miles from the marina. 
				</p>
		<h2 class="contenth2">Boat Rentals</h2>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Where do we pick up the boat rental?</h3>
				<p>Due to the Clearwater Marina being a high-traffic area, all boat rentals will start and end at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6cK1JSQcvBmywBgK8">Belleair Boat Ramp.</a> 
				Your boat will be in the water at the time of your arrival. If you requested to rent gear in addition to the boat, they will be on the boat and ready for use when you arrive. 
				On the weekends, we suggest arriving five minutes prior to launch time to ensure you can find parking.<br><br>Address: 3900 W Bay Dr, Belleair Bluffs, FL 33770 United States
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Do I need a boating license to rent your boats?</h3>
				<p>Yes. If you were born after January 1, 1998, you need a boating license to operate our vessels. You can apply for a temporary boating
				license by completing a <a href="https://www.boat-ed.com/floridarental/?tap_a=20415-39769e&tap_s=232637-895530">Florida State-Approved Boat Rental Course.</a>
				If completing a boat rental course, please follow these four steps:
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Register and pay the course fee.</li>
						<li>Study the material and/or take the test.</li>
						<li>Once you've passed the test, fill out your certificate information and create your 4-digit pin.</li>
						<li>Download or print your course completion certificate and bring it with you.</li>
					</ol>
				<p>If you have an out-of-state boating license, they may be applicable in the state of Florida if bearing a 
				<a href="https://www.nasbla.org/nasblamain/education/reciprocity">NASBLA accredidation.</a>
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">How old do I need to be to rent a boat?</h3>
				<p>Renters must be at least 21 years old to rent our boats. A valid government-issued ID must be shown on the launch day to confirm identity.</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Can I take the boat anywhere?</h3>
				<p>No. We limit the riding area based on water conditions. Generally, approved areas for rental boats are the intra-coastal and near coastal waters.</p>
		<h2 class="contenth2">Lessons</h2>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Why do I need to sign a waiver for lessons?</h3>
				<p>The government mandates participants to read and sign liability waivers for all fishing lessons in the state of Florida in case of injury or accidents
				that occurred while on company property.
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">If I cancel a lesson, am I able to reschedule for a day that you don't offer that lesson?</h3>
				<p>No. If you or the weather cancels a lesson, you will automatically be rescheduled to the next class date. If you cannot make the next class, you will be scheduled for the 
				next date. If part of a group course, it may take more than one Class launch to complete the course in its entirety. In that case, you will be grouped with the next Class launch, 
				and will need to wait until the Class reaches the class you last completed to continue the course. 
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">What is a 'Class'?</h3>
				<p>Our group courses are only offered by Class launch. The first launch of the year is always Class Alpha. Becuase we have multiple instructors, each instructor is responsible
				for their own group of Classes. Classes are named alphabetically and restart every 6 months. Your Class name reflects which instructor you have and your Class's start and end 
				dates.
				</p>
		<h2 class="contenth2">Additional Costs</h2>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Is there a security deposit?</h3>
				<p>Yes. We require a $250 security deposit per vessel rental, a $150 security deposit for charters, and a $50 security deposit for gear rentals. The funds will be released
				back to you once all our equipment has completed the return check-in.
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Is the price of gas included with the total charter/boat rental cost?</h3>
				<p>No. On the day of your launch, our captains will fuel your boat with enough fuel to cover your trip time plus 30 minutes reserve. You will be charged for the amount
				of fuel used on your trip. You will not be charged for any fuel not used. Our billing staff will email you an invoice with the total fuel charge one day after your launch. 
				</p>
		<h2 class="contenth2">Policies & Procedures</h2>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Can I bring my own gear to any of your services I book?</h3>
				<p>Yes! If you have your own gear (rods, reel, tackle, bait, etc.), we highly encourage you to bring it on your launch! We only ask that you not share your gear with
				other parties that may be with you. If you do not own your own hardware, don't worry! Our charters include the essential fishing equipment. If you are renting one of our boats 
				and would like to fish on your launch, you can also <a href="gear.html"><b>rent our gear!</b></a>
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Can I make reservations?</h3>
				<p>Yes. You may make a reservation for any charter or rental. We highly recommend planning weekend excursions at least one week in advance and at least two weeks ahead
				for holiday weekends.
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">What time should we arrive? </h3>
				<p>We require charter and boat rental guests to arrive at least 15 minutes prior to departure. This gives our staff enough time to brief charter passengers, instruct 
				boat rental drivers on the riding area, provide details on route planning, and orientate guests to the features of our boats. If you're late, you're cutting into your 
				booking time. 
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">What is the cancellation policy?</h3>
				<p>A 72-hour notice of cancellation is required to avoid a $100 cancellation fee. No-shows will be charged the full rate of their reservation.</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">What if bad weather is in the area?</h3>
				<p>If you make a reservation and the weather is bad (issued via Small Craft Advisories, Hazard Statements, or Limited Visibility warnings), there is no cancellation fee.
				You have the option to cancel your launch (with a full refund) or to reschedule for a better time or day. If you are already on the water when the weather turns bad, you 
				will only be charged for total time on the water, or until you are back at the docks. 
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">What if the boat breaks down?</h3>
				<p>Should the boat develop any issues during your excursion, call us IMMEDIATELY for assistance. Our vessels are also equipped with handheld VHF radios capable of 
				transmitting distress calls. If you are in an area of bad/weak cell service, or cannot reach our staff, please use VHF-FM Channel 16 to relay a distress signal. 
				The U.S. Coast Guard monitors this channel and will be able to provide assistance in the event of an emergency. 
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Do I need a fishing license to fish?</h3>
				<p>Yes. Florida now requires people to possess a fishing license anytime a line is put in the water. Contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 
				to purchase a fishing license at <a href="tel:888-347-4356">1-888-347-4356</a> or at <a href="https://myfwc.com/">myfwc.com</a>. 
				</p>
			<h3 class="alignleft">Can we tow items behind the boat?</h3>
				<p>No. For safety and insurance reasons, we do not allow any of our vessels (charter and rental) to be used for towing activities.</p>
